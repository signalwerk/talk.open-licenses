---
## Myths

* **©-Symbol** doesn't change anything
* Forget **«fair use»** in Switzerland.<br /> If you use it *you need to have a licence* for it.


---
## Spirit of Open Source (Software)

* **We get for** *«free»* **and share for** *«free»* <br />We program (write text) and put it free for others
* **«Standing on the shoulders of giants»** <br />We use Open Source products so we contribute to it


---
## Free in English

* **Frei/libre**: *free*
* **Gratis/gratuit**: *free*

---
## Free in English

* You get a program **for 0$**: <br />*it's for free*
* You get a the **source code** for the Program: <br />*it's free*
---
## Terms

* **Free as in** *free speech* → you get the **source code**
* **Free as in** *free beer* → you get it for **$0**
---
## Other terms

* *Libre* → Free as in **free speech**
* *FLOSS* → Free as in **free speech**
* *«Open Source»* → in «web-world» we usually mean FLOSS/Libre

[Example Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/license.html)

# Licences

---
## General

* You *always need a Licence* from the author to use it
* You **buy** it or the author licences it for **free**
---
## Source Code or content/artwork?

* Don't use **software-licences** on *artwork and content*
* Content/artwork also has communities and licences to share: **Creative Commons**


---
## Creative Commons, Public domain, …

* **Creative Commons** → different licences
* **Public Domain** → no restrictions

[Example Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/license)

---
## Groups of libre software licences

* **permissive** licenses (Open Source)
* **share-alike** license (Open Source)

---

## Permissive licenses

* Examples: *MIT, BSD, ISC, ...*
* often **short and easy** to understand
* basically: **do what you want **
* be carefull: **don't remove copyright**, sometimes you have to **redistribute the licence** with the software

---
## Share-alike license

* Examples: *GPL, LGPL*
* If you include GPL → your code becomes GPL (**viral license**)
* If you change/modify GPL → you **need to publish it** (! not optional !)

---
## What shoud I take?

* Today in the **context of web** it's probably good to take a *«permissive licenses»*
* Be **careful with LGPL/GPL**
* You can also take a dual-licence-strategy
---
## What did others take?

* Always **check the licence** of a repo!
* Create a *`LICENSE`-File* in your repos

[Example React](https://github.com/facebook/react)

---
## Work to protect/share

* We probably **earn money for solutions** not for tools/libaries
* Always **send fixes «upstream»**
* Open Source if you **think others can use it** (general problem)
* Open Source so **others understand it**: Documentation, example-code, ...


---
# Liip

* We need a system **how to support open source projects**
* We need a system to track **contributions of Liip and Liipers**
* There's a [Zebra-Project](https://zebra.liip.ch/project/3332) (I didn't create it)
