I would like to give a LiipTalk at the 25th of August 2020.
Title: Licences for Open Source Software and Free Content
Content:
Why and how to apply licences for Open Source Software and Free Content?
* What is threshold of originality?
* Whats an appropriate licence for my work?
* Is it now free as in "free speech" or as in "free beer"?
* Good and bad of copyleft?
